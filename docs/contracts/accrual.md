# Accrual Contract API Reference

The Accrual contract tracks each user's point-accrual clock and converts pending points into AMT tokens on claim, coordinating with the Registry and Token contracts.

## Public Functions

### initialize

```rust
pub fn initialize(
    env: Env,
    admin: Address,
    bot_nft: Address,
    registry: Address,
    points_per_amt: u64,
) -> Result<(), AccrualError>
```

Initialize the contract with an admin address, the bot_nft and registry addresses, and the points-to-AMT conversion rate. Requires authorization from `admin`. The registry address is stored so `start_accrual` can verify registration up front (#415).

- `admin`: The contract administrator address.
- `bot_nft`: The bot NFT contract used to derive each user's accrual rate.
- `registry`: The registry contract used to verify `is_registered(user)`.
- `points_per_amt`: Number of points required to mint 1 AMT unit. Must be non-zero.

Errors:
- `AlreadyInitialized`: The contract has already been initialized.
- `InvalidConfig`: `points_per_amt` is `0`.

Example:

```rust
accrual_client.initialize(&admin, &bot_nft_id, &registry_id, &100_u64);
```

---

### start_accrual

```rust
pub fn start_accrual(env: Env, user: Address) -> Result<(), AccrualError>
```

Start the accrual clock for `user` at the combined rate of the bots they own, read from the bot_nft contract. Requires authorization from `user`. Can only be called once per user.

Errors:
- `AlreadyStarted`: `user` already has an accrual record.
- `NotRegistered`: `user` is not registered in the registry contract (#415).
- `NoBots`: `user` owns no bots, so the derived rate is zero.

Example:

```rust
accrual_client.start_accrual(&user);
```

---

### pending_points

```rust
pub fn pending_points(env: Env, user: Address) -> Result<u128, AccrualError>
```

Compute the points accrued since `user`'s `last_claim_ts`, based on elapsed time and `rate`. Read-only; does not mutate state.

Errors:
- `NotStarted`: `user` has no accrual record.

Example:

```rust
let pending = accrual_client.pending_points(&user);
```

---

### get_accrual_state

```rust
pub fn get_accrual_state(env: Env, user: Address) -> Option<AccrualState>
```

Return `Some(AccrualState { last_claim_ts, carry_points, lifetime_points, rate, started_at })` for `user`, or `None` if accrual has not started. The state carries everything the dashboard needs in one call, including the rate used for client-side interpolation (#418).

Example:

```rust
let state = accrual_client.get_accrual_state(&user);
```

---

### claim

```rust
pub fn claim(
    env: Env,
    user: Address,
    token_contract: Address,
    registry: Address,
) -> Result<i128, AccrualError>
```

Settle pending points for `user`: adds them to the Registry's `total_points`, mints any whole AMT units earned (`updated_points / points_per_amt`) via the Token contract, carries the remainder forward, and resets `last_claim_ts`. Requires authorization from `user`.

- `token_contract`: Address of the deployed AMT Token contract.
- `registry`: Address of the deployed Registry contract.

Returns the number of points settled in this claim (not the AMT amount minted).

Errors:
- `NotStarted`: `user` has no accrual record.
- `NotInitialized`: The contract configuration could not be read (not initialized).

Example:

```rust
let points_claimed = accrual_client.claim(&user, &token_id, &registry_id);
```

---

### settle

```rust
pub fn settle(env: Env, users: Vec<Address>) -> Result<u32, AccrualError>
```

Settle accrued points for up to `MAX_SETTLE_USERS` (25) users in one call, without minting and without any user's signature. For each user it does what `claim` does up to the mint: the points earned since `last_claim_ts` (plus the carried sub-hour remainder) are credited to the Registry's `total_points`, added to `carry_points` and `lifetime_points`, and `last_claim_ts` moves to now. The user's next `claim` then mints from the carried balance, so a settled user ends up with the same points and the same AMT as one who claimed directly.

Users with no accrual record, frozen users, users with nothing pending, and users whose registry credit is refused (a `fail_reg` event names them) are skipped without any change to their state, so one bad address cannot block a batch. Returns the number of users settled and emits `settle(user)` with `(pending, carry_points, lifetime_points)` for each.

**Why it is safe to leave permissionless.** Settling never moves value out of the system and never reduces what a user is owed: the pending amount is a pure function of stored state and the ledger clock, it is credited to the user's own profile, and the only thing a caller decides is *when* the credit is recorded, which `claim` would record identically. Calling it early, late or repeatedly gains nothing (a repeat within the same second credits zero), and every call is bounded by the user cap. What it enables is a keeper refreshing accounts whose persistent entries are approaching TTL expiry, or working through a queue of claims without each user signing.

Errors:
- `TooManyUsers`: More than 25 addresses were passed.
- `NotInitialized`: The registry address has not been configured.

Example:

```rust
let settled = accrual_client.settle(&vec![&env, user_a.clone(), user_b.clone()]);
```

---

### admin

```rust
pub fn admin(env: Env) -> Address
```

Return the current admin address. Panics if the contract has not been initialized.

Example:

```rust
let admin = accrual_client.admin();
```

---

### config

```rust
pub fn config(env: Env) -> Result<Config, AccrualError>
```

Return the current `Config` (`points_per_amt`).

Errors:
- `NotInitialized`: The contract has not been initialized.

Example:

```rust
let config = accrual_client.config();
```
